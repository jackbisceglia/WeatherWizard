# WeatherWizard
WeatherWizard is a clean and simple web app that displays weather information to the user

* It uses Flask and Python on the back-end for routing, API work, and data serving/templating
* It uses basic HTML and CSS on the front-end paired with Flask's jinja2 templating to handle dynamic display
* The UI is a mix of custom CSS and the Materialize UI framework

# Access
